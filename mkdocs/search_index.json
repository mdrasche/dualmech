After a brief delay period (3-5 sec), participants must determine whether they saw the probe item in the current memory set or not. The probe item can either be positive (the probe was in the current memory set) or negative (the probe was not in the current memory set). The negative probes can either be recent (the probe was in the previous memory set) or non-recent (the probe was not presented in the current or previous memory set). See \nSternberg (1966)\n for the original task and \nBurgess \n Braver (2010)\n for a recent usage of this task. \n\n\n?Previous/General Research?\n\n\nHow does this fit into the DMC Framework?\n\n\nMemory Load\n\n\nWhen the memory set size is small, participants with a range of working memory capacities are able to hold all of the memory items in working memory. In this scenario, participants tend to adopt a more proactive strategy, where they actively maintain the current memory set. This strategy would be indicated behaviorally by a low amount of errors and a fast response time on positive trials. From a neuorimaging perspective, participants using proactive strategy, should display delay-related activation dynamics in lateral PFC. \n\n\nHowever, as the memory set grows, individual difference come more into play. When the memory set is too large for a participant to maintain all items in working memory, he/she may begin to adopt a more reactive strategy where the memory items are stored in long-term memory.\n\n\nBy presenting all small memory loads in a session or all large memory loads, particpants may shift to a more proactive strategy in the former case or a more reactive in strategy in the latter. Thus, although a 5-item memory set may appear in both sessions, participants may respond to those same memory load sizes in different ways, because the rest of the items have shifted them into a certain mindset. These 5-item memory sets allow us to make comparisons between responses during low load sessions and high load sessions, without confounding difficulty (e.g. comparing responses to a 3-item memory set to a 7-item memory set).\n\n\nRecent-Negative Proportion\n\n\nCurrent Paradigm\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nEach memory set was presented in two parts, each for 2000 ms. Following the encoding period, there was a 4000 ms retention interval, where only a fixation point in the center of the screen was displayed. After the retention period, one probe item appeared in the center of the screen. Participants had 2000 ms in which to respond. See ... for a more detailed description.\n\n\nStimuli\n\n\nThe memory items used in our task are 4-6 letter nouns with 1 or 2 syllables. The items were compiled using the \nThe English Lexicon Project\n. Click \nhere\n for the pool of words used along with properties of those words.\n\n\nManipulations\n\n\nMemory Load\n\n\nIn each version of the task, participants were presented with either \nShort\n (2-5 items) or \nLong\n (5-8 items) word lists.\n\n\nRecent-Negative Proportion\n\n\nIn each version of the task, participants were presented with a \nHigh\n (40% of trials) or \nLow\n (10% of trials) proportion of Recent Negative trials.
